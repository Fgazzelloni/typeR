## Overview

The typeR package provides excellent support for **Quarto presentations**, allowing you to create engaging live coding demonstrations for:

- 🎓 **Teaching** - Show students how code is written step-by-step
- 🎤 **Conference talks** - Demonstrate concepts with live coding effects
- 📹 **Tutorial videos** - Record professional coding tutorials
- 👥 **Workshops** - Engage audiences with interactive demonstrations

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Quarto Presentation

First, create a Quarto presentation file with reveal.js format:

```yaml
---
title: "My R Demo"
format: revealjs
---

## Slide 1

```{r}
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```

## Slide 2

```{r}
plot(x, x^2)
```
```

Save this as `my-demo.qmd`.

### 2. Run with typeRun()

```{r}
# Basic usage
typeRun("my-demo.qmd")

# With custom settings
typeRun("my-demo.qmd", delay = 0.08, jitter = 0.02)
```

**What happens:**
- YAML header is skipped automatically
- Slide dividers (`##`) are typed out
- R code chunks execute in real-time
- Narrative text types without executing

## Included Examples

The package includes ready-to-use Quarto presentation examples:

```{r examples}
# Find the example file
demo_file <- system.file("examples/demo-presentation.qmd", package = "typeR")

# Run it
typeRun(demo_file)

# Or the simpler version
simple_file <- system.file("examples/simple-presentation.qmd", package = "typeR")
typeRun(simple_file, delay = 0.05)
```

## Supported Quarto Formats

typeR works with various Quarto presentation formats:

### reveal.js (Default)

```yaml
format: revealjs
```

Most popular format for HTML presentations. Supports themes, transitions, and interactive features.

### PowerPoint

```yaml
format: pptx
```

While the typing effect works during development, the final PowerPoint won't show animation.

### Beamer (PDF)

```yaml
format: beamer
```

LaTeX-based PDF slides. typeRun() helps during development to test code.

## Best Practices

### 1. Adjust Typing Speed

For presentations, slower typing is often better:

```{r speed}
# Slower for readability
typeRun("presentation.qmd", delay = 0.10, jitter = 0.03)

# Very slow for teaching
typeRun("presentation.qmd", delay = 0.15, jitter = 0.05)

# Fast for quick demos
typeRun("presentation.qmd", delay = 0.03, jitter = 0.01)
```

### 2. Control Output Length

Prevent long outputs from scrolling off screen:

```{r output}
# Limit to 5 lines
typeRun("presentation.qmd", max_print = 5)

# Show more for detailed examples
typeRun("presentation.qmd", max_print = 15)
```

### 3. Use Interactive Pause

During live presentations, pause to answer questions:

```{r pause, eval=FALSE}
typeRun("presentation.qmd")
# Press ESC to pause
# Enter 1 to resume
# Enter 2 to stop
```

### 4. Test Before Presenting

Always do a full run-through before your actual presentation:

```{r test}
# Full test run
typeRun("my-talk.qmd", delay = 0.05)

# Check for errors or unexpected output
```

## Example: Full Presentation Workflow

### Step 1: Create Content

```yaml
---
title: "Data Analysis in R"
format: 
  revealjs:
    theme: moon
    transition: slide
---

## Introduction

Today we'll analyze the mtcars dataset.

## Load Data

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars, 3)
```

## Summary Statistics

```{r}
summary(mtcars$mpg)
```

## Visualization

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg,
     xlab = "Weight", ylab = "MPG",
     main = "Fuel Efficiency vs Weight")
```

## Model

```{r}
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(model)
```

## Thank You!
```

### Step 2: Practice

```{r practice}
# Save the above as "data-analysis.qmd"
typeRun("data-analysis.qmd", delay = 0.06, max_print = 8)
```

### Step 3: Present Live

During your presentation:

1. Open R/RStudio
2. Load typeR: `library(typeR)`
3. Run: `typeRun("data-analysis.qmd", delay = 0.08)`
4. Let the code type out automatically
5. Use ESC to pause for questions

## Advanced Features

### Custom Environment

Keep your workspace clean by using a separate environment:

```{r env}
# Create isolated environment
demo_env <- new.env()

# Run presentation in that environment
typeRun("presentation.qmd", envir = demo_env)

# Your global environment remains clean
ls()  # Nothing added here
ls(demo_env)  # All demo objects here
```

### Combining Multiple Presentations

```{r multiple}
# Run a series of short demos
demos <- c("intro.qmd", "advanced.qmd", "qa.qmd")

for (demo in demos) {
  cat("\n\n=== Starting:", demo, "===\n\n")
  typeRun(demo, delay = 0.06)
  cat("\n\n=== Finished:", demo, "===\n\n")
}
```

## Tips for Success

### Do's ✅

- **Practice** your presentation multiple times
- **Adjust delay** to match your speaking pace
- **Use max_print** to avoid overwhelming output
- **Test plots** to ensure they display correctly
- **Prepare backup** - have slides ready if tech fails

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't** type too fast - audience needs time to read
- **Don't** show massive outputs - use head() or sample()
- **Don't** skip testing - always do a dry run
- **Don't** forget** ESC pauses if you need to stop

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Code types too fast

**Solution:** Increase the delay parameter

```{r}
typeRun("presentation.qmd", delay = 0.12)
```

### Issue: Output is too long

**Solution:** Use max_print or modify your code to show less

```{r}
typeRun("presentation.qmd", max_print = 5)
```

### Issue: Need to stop mid-presentation

**Solution:** Press ESC, then choose option 2

### Issue: Plots don't display

**Solution:** Make sure your graphics device is open and functioning

```{r}
# Test graphics device
plot(1:10)  # Should work before starting typeRun
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Teaching a Course

```{r teaching}
# Week 1: Basics
typeRun("week1-intro.qmd", delay = 0.10)

# Week 2: Data manipulation
typeRun("week2-dplyr.qmd", delay = 0.08)

# Week 3: Visualization
typeRun("week3-ggplot.qmd", delay = 0.08)
```

### Conference Talk

```{r conference}
# 20-minute presentation
typeRun("conference-talk.qmd", 
        delay = 0.06,     # Fast enough to keep pace
        max_print = 6)    # Brief outputs
```

### Workshop

```{r workshop}
# Interactive 2-hour workshop
typeRun("workshop-morning.qmd",
        delay = 0.09,      # Slower for learning
        max_print = 8)

# Break, then afternoon session
typeRun("workshop-afternoon.qmd",
        delay = 0.09,
        max_print = 8)
```
