# Introduction

Welcome to the **typeR** package! 

In this vignette, you'll learn how to install the package, what it’s designed for, and how to use its core functionality. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced R user, this guide will help you get started on the right foot.

This package is designed to simulate typing effects in R scripts for presentations and tutorials.

---

## Installation

If you haven’t already, you can install the package. As soon as it becomes available on CRAN:

```R
install.packages("typeR")
```

Install the development version on GitHub:

```R
# Install devtools package if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}

# Install from GitHub
devtools::install_github("fgazzelloni/typeR")
```

After installation, load the package:

```R
library(typeR)
```

# Quick Start Example

Let’s dive into a simple example to show you how **typeR** works in practice.

## Example with a custom R script

The `typeR()` function can simulate typing an R script line by line in the R console. Here’s a basic example:

```R
library(typeR)

# Create a test script for demonstration
writeLines(c(
  "# Testing typeR",
  "x <- 1:10",
  "y <- x*2",
  "plot(x, y)"
), "test_script.R")

# Simulate typing the script
typeR("test_script.R", delay = 0.05)
```


And here’s what the output looks like:

![typeR demo](images/typeR_demo.gif){width="600px" height="400px"}


Check out the function reference documentation for details on the available parameters and their usage.

- Explore the package documentation: `?typeR` 
- Check out the other vignettes or tutorials on advanced topics.
- Contribute or share your feature ideas via [GitHub Issues link](https://github.com/Fgazzelloni/typeR/issues).
